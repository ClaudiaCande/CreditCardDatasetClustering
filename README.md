## Introduction

Clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. In this project, we apply clustering algorithms to credit card data to uncover hidden patterns and segment customers based on their spending behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains anonymized credit card transactions. It includes various features such as transaction amounts, frequency, and other behavioral data points. The dataset is pre-processed to ensure privacy and confidentiality.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

## Usage
To explore the analysis, clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook:


    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    jupyter notebook creditcardclustering.ipynb


Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis and visualize the results.

## Methodology
The notebook covers the following steps:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand its structure and characteristics.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for clustering.
Clustering Algorithms: Applying algorithms such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to segment the data.
Evaluation: Assessing the quality of the clusters using metrics like silhouette score.

## Results
The clustering analysis reveals distinct customer segments, each with unique spending behaviors. These insights can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
